# MovieDB Recommender

## This project is being maintained by [Wutang04](https://github.com/Wutang03) and [DeejC04](https://github.com/DeejC04), and of course, our contributors!
We are currently utilizing [The Movie Database API](https://www.themoviedb.org/?language=en-US)

---

## Current functionality:

- Allows user to input an amount of movies to be returned
- That number of movies is returned

> **NOTE**: Categories currently **DO NOT** work. Contributors welcome to help set them up to filter results!

## Ideal functionality

- Filter by category
- Images with links to the movies' IMDB page
- Show similar movies
- Better UI (please lol)
- And more!

## Contributing

For contributing ideas, create an issue with the tag "enhancement" detailing your idea, nuances, etc.

For contributing code, follow these steps:

1. Fork your own branch
2. Clone that fork onto your PC
3. Create a separate working branch
  - IMPORTANT SUBSTEP: Get your own API key from [TMDB](https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/getting-started/introduction). Within `.env.example`, replace `YOUR_KEY_HERE` with your newly acquired API key. Finally, rename `.env.example` to `.env`
  - Veriy that `.env` is listed in your `.gitignore` file
4. If you wish, create a virtual environment.
5. Whether or not you created a virtual environment, install the required packages/libraries by inputting `pip install -r requirements.txt` into your terminal.
